                Winner of the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction <br>
                <br>
                In Amity and Prosperity, the prizewinning poet and <br>
                journalist Eliza Griswold tells the story of the energy <br>
                boom’s impact on a small town at the edge of Appalachia <br>
                and one woman’s transformation from a struggling single <br>
                parent to an unlikely activist.
                <br>
                Stacey Haney is a local nurse working hard to raise two kids and <br>
                keep up her small farm when the fracking boom comes to her <br>
                hometown of Amity, Pennsylvania. Intrigued by reports of <br>
                lucrative natural gas leases in her neighbors’ mailboxes, she <br>
                strikes a deal with a Texas-based energy company. Soon trucks <br>
                begin rumbling past her small farm, a fenced-off drill site rises on <br>
                an adjacent hilltop, and domestic animals and pets start to die. <br>
                When mysterious sicknesses begin to afflict her children, she <br>
                appeals to the company for help. Its representatives insist that <br>
                nothing is wrong.
                <br>
                Alarmed by her children’s illnesses, Haney joins with neighbors <br>
                and a committed husband-and-wife legal team to investigate <br>
                what’s really in the water and air. Against local opposition, Haney <br>
                and her allies doggedly pursue their case in court and begin to <br>
                expose the damage that’s being done to the land her family has <br>
                lived on for centuries. Soon a community that has long been <br>
                suspicious of outsiders faces wrenching new questions about <br>
                who is responsible for their fate, and for redressing it: The <br>
                faceless corporations that are poisoning the land? The <br>
                environmentalists who fail to see their economic distress? A <br>
                federal government that is mandated to protect but fails on the <br>
                job? Drawing on seven years of immersive reporting, Griswold <br>
                reveals what happens when an imperiled town faces a crisis of <br>
                values, and a family wagers everything on an improbable quest <br>
                for justice.
