                This “ingenious reckoning with the past” (The New York <br>
                Times), by award-winning artist Nora Krug investigates the <br>
                hidden truths of her family’s wartime history in Nazi <br>
                Germany.</strong><br>
                    <br>
                Nora Krug was born decades after the fall of the Nazi regime, <br>
                but the Second World War cast a long shadow over her <br>
                childhood and youth in the city of Karlsruhe, Germany. Yet she <br>
                knew little about her own family’s involvement; though all four <br>
                grandparents lived through the war, they never spoke of it. <br>
                    <br>
                After twelve years in the US, Krug realizes that living abroad has <br>
                only intensified her need to ask the questions she didn’t dare to <br>
                s a child. Returning to Germany, she visits archives, conducts <br>
                research, and interviews family members, uncovering in the <br>
                process the stories of her maternal grandfather, a driving teacher <br>
                in Karlsruhe during the war, and her father’s brother Franz-Karl, <br>
                who died as a teenage SS soldier. In this extraordinary quest, <br>
                “Krug erases the boundaries between comics, scrapbooking, <br>
                and collage as she endeavors to make sense of 20th-century <br>
                history, the Holocaust, her German heritage, and her family's <br>
                place in it all” (The Boston Globe). A highly inventive, “thoughtful, <br>
                engrossing” (Minneapolis Star-Tribune) graphic memoir, <br>
                Belonging “packs the power of Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home and <br>
                David Small’s Stitches” (NPR.org). <br>
