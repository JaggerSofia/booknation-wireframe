                "The best novel ever written about trees, and really just one <br>
                of the best novels, period." ―Ann Patchett <br>
                <br>
                The Overstory, winner of the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, is a <br>
                sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is <br>
                also a stunning evocation of―and paean to―the natural world. <br>
                From the roots to the crown and back to the seeds, Richard <br>
                Powers’s twelfth novel unfolds in concentric rings of interlocking <br>
                fables that range from antebellum New York to the late twentieth-<br>
                century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond. There <br>
                is a world alongside ours―vast, slow, interconnected, <br>
                resourceful, magnificently inventive, and almost invisible to us. <br>
                This is the story of a handful of people who learn how to see that <br>
                world and who are drawn up into its unfolding catastrophe. <br>
