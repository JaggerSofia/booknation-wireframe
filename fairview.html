            “Dazzling and ruthless…One of the most exquisitely and <br>
            systematically arranged ambushes of an unsuspecting audience <br> 
            in years…A glorious, scary reminder of the unmatched power of <br>
            live theater to rattle, roil and shake us wide awake.” —Ben <br>
            Brantley, New York Times <br>
            <br>
            Grandma’s birthday approaches. Beverly is organizing the <br>
            perfect dinner, but everything seems doomed from the start: the <br>
            silverware is all wrong, the carrots need chopping and the radio <br>
            is on the fritz. What at first appears to be a family comedy takes <br>
            a sharp, sly turn into a startling examination of deep-seated <br>
            paradigms about race in America.
