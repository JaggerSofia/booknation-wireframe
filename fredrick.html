                “Extraordinary…a great American biography” (The New <br>
                Yorker) of the most important African-American of the <br>
                nineteenth century: Frederick Douglass, the escaped slave <br>
                who became the greatest orator of his day and one of the <br>
                leading abolitionists and writers of the era. <br>
                <br>
                As a young man Frederick Douglass (1818–1895) escaped from <br>  
                slavery in Baltimore, Maryland. He was fortunate to have been <br>
                taught to read by his slave owner mistress, and he would go on <br>
                to become one of the major literary figures of his time. His very <br>
                existence gave the lie to slave owners: with dignity and great <br>
                intelligence he bore witness to the brutality of slavery. <br>
                <br>
                Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass spoke <br>
                widely, using his own story to condemn slavery. By the Civil War, <br> 
                Douglass had become the most famed and widely travelled <br>
                orator in the nation. In his unique and eloquent voice, written and <br>
                spoken, Douglass was a fierce critic of the United States as well <br>
                as a radical patriot. After the war he sometimes argued politically <br>
                with younger African Americans, but he never forsook either the <br>
                Republican party or the cause of black civil and political rights. <br>
                <br>
                In this “cinematic and deeply engaging” (The New York Times <br>
                Book Review) biography, David Blight has drawn on new <br>
                information held in a private collection that few other historian <br>
                have consulted, as well as recently discovered issues of <br>
                Douglass’s newspapers. “Absorbing and even moving…a <br>
                brilliant book that speaks to our own time as well as Douglass’s” <br>
                (The Wall Street Journal), Blight’s biography tells the fascinating <br>
                story of Douglass’s two marriages and his complex extended <br>
                family. “David Blight has written the definitive biography of <br>
                Frederick Douglass…a powerful portrait of one of the most <br>
                important American voices of the nineteenth century” (The <br>
                Boston Globe). <br>
                <br>
                In addition to the Pulitzer Prize, Frederick Douglass won the <br>
                Bancroft, Parkman, Los Angeles Times (biography), Lincoln, <br>
                Plutarch, and Christopher awards and was named one of the <br>
                Best Books of 2018 by The New York Times Book Review, The <br>
                Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune, <br>
                The San Francisco Chronicle, and Time. <br>
