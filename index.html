            “Dazzling and ruthless…One of the most exquisitely <br>
            and systematically arranged ambushes of an <br>
            unsuspecting audience in years…A glorious, scary <br>
            reminder of the unmatched power of live theater <br>
            to rattle, roil and shake us wide awake.” —Ben <br>

            <h2>Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom</h2>
            <h3>by David W. Blight</h3>
            <p>**Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History**
                <br>
                “Extraordinary…a great American biography” <br>
                (The New Yorker) of the most important African- <br>
                American of the nineteenth century: Frederick <br>
                Douglass, the escaped slave who became the <br>
                greatest orator of day and one of the leading <br>
                abolitionists and writers of the era. <br>
                
                As a young man Frederick Douglass (1818–1895) <br>
                escaped from slavery in Baltimore, Maryland. <br>
                He was fortunate to have been taught to read <br>
                by his slave owner mistress, and he would go <br>
                on to become one of the major literary figures <br>
                of his time. His very existence gave the lie <br>
                to slave owners: with dignity and great <br>
                intelligence he bore witness to the brutality <br>
                of slavery.
