                <strong>The first comprehensive biography of <br>
                Weegee―photographer, “psychic,” ultimate New <br>
                Yorker―from Christopher Bonanos, author of Instant: The <br>
                Story of Polaroid. </strong><br>
                    <br>
                Arthur Fellig’s ability to arrive at a crime scene just as the cops <br>
                did was so uncanny that he renamed himself “Weegee,” claiming <br>
                that he functioned as a human Ouija board. Weegee <br>
                documented better than any other photographer the crime, grit, <br>
                and complex humanity of midcentury New York City. In Flash, we <br>
                get a portrait not only of the man (both flawed and deeply <br>
                talented, with generous appetites for publicity, women, and hot <br> 
                pastrami) but also of the fascinating time and place that he <br>
                occupied. <br>
                <br>
                From self-taught immigrant kid to newshound to art-world darling <br>
                to latter-day caricature―moving from the dangerous streets <br>
                of New York City to the celebrity culture of Los Angeles and then to <br>
                Europe for a quixotic late phase of experimental photography <br>
                and filmmaking―Weegee lived a life just as worthy of <br>
                documentation as the scenes he captured. With Flash, we have <br>
                an unprecedented and ultimately moving view of the man now <br>
                regarded as an innovator and a pioneer, an artist as well as a <br>
                newsman, whose photographs are among most powerful images <br>
                of urban existence ever made. <br>
